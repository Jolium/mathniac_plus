Add different numbers until you reach the 'Goal' value.\n
You may not repeat de same number.\n
Ex: if 'Goal' is equal to 15, '8 + 7' or '4 + 5 + 6' are possible combinations, but '7 + 7 + 1' or '7 + 4 + 4' are not.\n
You earn points depending on the length of the combination of different numbers you use to reach the 'Goal' value.\n
Ex: if 'Goal' is equal to 15 and you use the combination '8 + 7', you will get 10 points. But if you use the combination '4 + 5 + 6', you will get 18 points.\n
Combinations vs Points:\n
2 numbers: 2 x 5 = 10 points\n
3 numbers: 3 x 6 = 18 points\n
4 numbers: 4 x 7 = 28 points\n
5 numbers: 5 x 8 = 40 points\n
6 numbers: 6 x 9 = 54 points\n
- Every $vPointsToWinSecond points you will get 1 second extra to play.
